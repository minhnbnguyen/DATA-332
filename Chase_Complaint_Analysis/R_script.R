# anger (p = 0.002522): positive relationship
# joy (p = 0.01): negative relationship
# trust (p = 0.000456): positive relationship -> need more research and validate
# anticipation (p = 0.09): positive relationship -> need more research and validate

# Conclusion: significant predictor are anger and trust 
# Joy is significant in the coefficient test but not in the sequential test, suggesting it may share explanatory power with variables added earlier
# Sadness is significant in the sequential test but not in the coefficient test

# For a more robust conclusion, I would suggest:
# Focus on anger and trust as your primary findings since they are significant in both tests
# Acknowledge joy as potentially important since it's significant when controlling for all variables
# Consider whether to include sadness based on your research question and theoretical framework -> work backwards
