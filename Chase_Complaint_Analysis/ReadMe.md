## Introduction
This project analyzes the customer narrative complaint from JP Morgan Chase to find relationship between customer's emotion with complaint dispute rate. In this project, I compare the emotional content of disputed vs. non-disputed complaints to identify emotional patterns that might predict complaint resolution difficulty.

## Data Dictionary 📖
Our dataset includes the following columns:

- **Date.received**: Date that the complaint was received
- **Product**: Product that was complaint about (i.e Debt Collection, Mortgage,..)
- **Sub.product**: Sub category of the product (i.e Credit Card, Debit Card,...)
- **Issue**: Issue category
- **Sub.issue**: Sub issue category
- **Consumer.complaint.narrative**: Consumer explanation on the issue
- **Company.public.response**: Company public response via website or social media
- **Company**: Name of bank. Note: Our dataset includes all US banks, but for the range of this project I will filter out only JP Morgan Chase Co.
- **State**: State where the headquarter is located
- **ZIP.code**: ZIP code where the headquarter is located
- **Tags**: The department/office that the issue will be directed to 
- **Consumer.consent.provided.**: Consumer consent to public issue
- **Submitted.via**: Platform the issue was submitted
- **Date.sent.to.company**: Date that the issue was sent to the bank
- **Company.response.to.consumer**: Company resolution to the issue
- **Timely.response**: Whether if this is a timely response or not
- **Consumer.disputed.**: Whether if the consumer dispute the resolution or not
- **Complaint.ID**: The unique identifier of each complaint

## Data Cleaning Methodology To Ensure Tiday Data 🧹

### Tag column include multiple variables
- Split tag columns into seperate rows if there are more than 2 tags

```r
complaints_tibble <- complaints_tibble %>%
  separate_rows(Tags, sep = ", ")
```

### Standardize empty cells to na format
- Unified country name formats
- Standardized variations of USA/U.S.A to "United States"
- Determined missing countries from locality information

```r
# convert all empty cells into N/A instead of ""
col_w_empty_cells <- names(complaints_tibble[colSums(complaints_tibble == "", na.rm = TRUE) > 0])

complaints_tibble <- complaints_tibble %>%
  mutate(across(col_w_empty_cells, ~na_if(., "")))

# convert "N/A" to na
na_cols_logical <- sapply(complaints_tibble, function(x) {
  if(is.character(x)) {
    return(any(x == "N/A", na.rm = TRUE))
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
})

cols_with_NA_text <- names(na_cols_logical)[na_cols_logical]

complaints_tibble <- complaints_tibble %>%
  mutate(across(cols_with_NA_text, ~na_if(., "N/A")))

```

### Date Formatting 📆
- Converted all date column from varchar to date format

```r
complaints_tibble$Date.received <- as.Date(complaints_tibble$Date.receive, format = '%m/%d/%Y')
complaints_tibble$Date.sent.to.company <- as.Date(complaints_tibble$Date.sent.to.company, format = '%m/%d/%Y')
```

## Data Summary
- Our dataset spans nearly two years (Mar 2015 - Sep 2016) with 670,598 complaints
- These complaints come from 3,933 us banks 🏦
- The top 5 companies with most complaints are:
  1. Bank of America
  2. Wels Fargo & Company
  3. Equifax
  4. Experian
  5. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
👉 In the following analysis, we would focus on JPMorgan Chase only

## Key Findings

### High-level view of the customer complaint

- The most common problem are likely related to wrong information, lost, or failed issue

### Net sentiment emotions related to each product
![Net Sentiment](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/Chase_Complaint_Analysis/visualization/netsentiment.png)
- Net sentiment is the net emotion from each complaint (i.e net sentiment = positive - negative)
- We can see the largest emotion gap is in other financial services product, following by credit card and bank account or services, debt collection is also observed with large gap
- Since other financial services product is quite general, Chase should conduct more analysis on the credit card, bank account and debt collection product to identify the root cause that cause negative complaints.

### Comparative Analysis using nrc sentiment
![Emotional content](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/Chase_Complaint_Analysis/visualization/disputevsnondispute_emotion.png)
- Method: Compare the emotional content of disputed vs. non-disputed complaints
- Goal: Identify emotional patterns that might predict complaint resolution difficulty
- Result: Largest dispute ratio falls within negative and trust emotions

  
## Perform statistical analysis to find correlation between emotion and dispute rate

### Run logistic regression
![Logistic](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/Chase_Complaint_Analysis/visualization/Regression.png)

Significant predictors are
- anger (p = 0.002522): positive relationship 💢
- joy (p = 0.01): negative relationship 😊
- trust (p = 0.000456): positive relationship 🙏🏻
- anticipation (p = 0.09): positive relationship 😌


### Validate Model with Chi-Square Test
![Validate](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/Chase_Complaint_Analysis/visualization/ChiSquared.png)

Significant predictors are
- Anger (p = 9.61e)
- Trust (p = 3.79e)
- Sadness (p = 0.01)

- Joy is significant in the coefficient test but not in the sequential test, suggesting it may share explanatory power with variables added earlier
- Sadness is significant in the sequential test but not in the coefficient test

## Final Suggestions
- Focus on anger and trust as your primary findings since they are significant in both tests
- Acknowledge joy as potentially important since it's significant when controlling for all variables
- Consider whether to include sadness based on your research question and theoretical framework -> work backwards
