- We decided to make a stacked bar chart and group the mph by every 5 miles for the x value and get the count of cars for the y value so that we can get a range of what mph range is most likely to slow down.
- The speed range that slowed down the most was 16 - 20 mph.
- It is important to note that the speed limit for that spot was 30 mph, and there were no cars that slowed down if they were going past the 30 mph speed limit.
