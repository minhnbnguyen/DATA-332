# Patient Billing

## DESCRIPTION
By Minh Nguyen

This project explores the clinic dataset from Kaggle to give insights into the clinic patient segmentation. For this project, I also learn how to join the data together with relational keys.

**1. Reason for Visit based on walk in or not?**

ðŸ‘‰ Generally, patient prefer to schedule appointment than walk-in. Except in October

**2. Reason for visit based on City**

ðŸ‘‰ All patient are from Georgia, especially from Atlanta - the largest city in this state.

**3. Total invoice amount based on reason for visit**

ðŸ‘‰ The clinic revenue is at its peak in March, and lowest in April.
ðŸ‘‰ The clinic earn more from appointment than walk-in, which makes sense since the number of visit by walk-in is lower than appointment

**3. Total invoice amount based on each generation**

ðŸ‘‰ Older generation pay more for appointment visit, while younger generation pay more for walk-in.
