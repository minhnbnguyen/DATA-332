By Minh Nguyen

This project explores the clinic dataset from Kaggle to give insights into the clinic patient segmentation. For this project, I also learn how to join the data together with relational keys.



They will discover insights into the data such as reason for visit segmented (stacked bar chart)by month of the year. 

Reason for visit based on walk in or not. 

Reason for visit based on City/State or zip code

Total invoice amount based on reason for visit. Segmented (stacked bar chart) with it was paid. 

And student is to find one insight into the data that they find interesting. In a chart.

ðŸ‘‰ Data Science attracts the largest amount of students, followed by Computer Science and Digital Marketing  
ðŸ‘‰ We can see a trend of students majoring in STEM related majors (Computer Science, Data Science, and Digital Security)

**2. Reason for visit based on City**
