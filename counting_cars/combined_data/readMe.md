# Counting Cars Combined üöó

## Minh Nguyen ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Introduction
This project is the next step of the Counting Cars project, which took all of my DATA-332 classmates' data, wrangled, cleaned and ingested them into my previous shiny app. This project focuses on data wrangling and data cleaning, following the tidy data guideline.

## Data Dictionary üìñ
Our dataset includes the following columns:

- **date**: recorded date
- **time**: recorded time
- **initial_speed**: first observed car speed
- **slow_down**: whether the car slow down after seeing the sign or not
- **body_type**: car style

## My Cleaning Process üßπ

### Create a lookup car type table for Tanner.
I stole the code from their Shiny app and edit it
```r
car_types <- c(
  "1" = "Emergency",
  "2" = "Hatchback",
  "3" = "Sedan",
  "4" = "SUV",
  "5" = "Van",
  "6" = "Minivan",
  "7" = "Motorcycle",
  "8" = "Coupe",
  "9" = "Truck",
  "10" = "Pickup Truck"
)

tanner_car_lookup <- data.frame(
  number = as.integer(names(car_types)),
  car_type = tolower(as.character(car_types)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
#Join that table with type of car
tanner_joined <- left_join(tanner_data, tanner_car_lookup, by = c("Type_of_Car" = "number"))
```
### Put into a clean dataframe following the structure in the data dictionary
```r
# Ensure data type as date
tanner_data$Date_Recorded <- as.POSIXct(tanner_data$Date_Recorded, format="%m/%d/%Y") 
tanner_data$Time_Recorded <- as.POSIXct(tanner_data$Time_Recorded, format = "%H:%M:%S")

tanner_data_clean <- data.frame(
  date = format(tanner_data$Date_Recorded, "%m/%d/%Y"),
  time = format(tanner_data$Time_Recorded, "%H:%M"),
  initial_speed = tanner_data$Initial_Read,
  slow_down = ifelse(tanner_data$Difference_In_Readings < 1, "no",
                     ifelse(tanner_data$Difference_In_Readings == 1, "yes",
                            ifelse(tanner_data$Difference_In_Readings > 1, "yes", tanner_data$Difference_In_Readings))),
  body_type = tanner_joined$car_type

```
### Repeat the process for other datasource (adjust accordingly) and bind them together
```r
dataset <- rbind(ahbid_data_clean,
                    nbasil_data_clean,
                    nick_data_clean,
                    nsrine_data_clean,
                    tanner_data_clean,
                    tommy_data_clean,
                    x_data_clean)
```
### Ensure consistency in union dataset
```r
unique_body_type <- unique(dataset$body_type)
print(unique_body_type)

dataset$body_type <- recode(dataset$body_type,
                               "sevan" = "sedan",
                               "suv " = "suv",
                               "pickup_truck" = "pickup truck",
                               "muscle_car" = "muscle car",
                               "van " = "van",
                               "van_" = "van")
# Check category again
unique_body_type <- unique(dataset$body_type)
print(unique_body_type)
```

## Data Summary
- The lowest speed recorded is 10 miles/h
- The highest speed recorded is 44 miles/h
- The average speed recorded is 29.24 miles/h

## Key Findings

### Time Analysis
![Word Cloud](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/counting_cars/graphs/car_brand.png)
- The chart shows Afternon is the most frequently observed time with more than 600 cars, followed by Morning and Evening.
- This either suggests that students are mostly free in the afternoon to observe car, or that afternoon has more cars on the road.
- Either way, this is just a brief conclusion, with further study including larger random sample needed.



### Vehicle Style Analysis
![Net Sentiment](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/counting_cars/combined_data/graphs/body_type.png)
- The chart shows that SUVs are the most common vehicle type with nearly 400 cars, followed by sedans (300) and pickup trucks/trucks (120).
- Other styles like hatchbacks, bugs, and coupes the least.
- This suggests SUVs and sedans make up the majority of vehicles observed in the area.



### Speed Analysis
![Emotional content](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/counting_cars/combined_data/graphs/time_of_day.png)
- We decided to make a stacked bar chart and group the mph by every 5 miles for the x value and get the count of cars for the y value
- Therefore, we can get a range of what mph range is most likely to slow down.
- The speed range that slowed down the most was 26-30 mph.
- It is important to note that the speed limit for that spot was 30 mph.

## Reflection

### What I learned in general
- How to deploy a shiny app and the importance of file organization. I was struggling to deploy the app due to mismatch in my file path. It was painful ü•≤.
- Importance of planning ahead. Instead of blindly cleaning each file, I set up a clear data structure before hand following the tidy data guideline. This serves as a guiding map and save so much time!

### What I learned about collecting data
- Cannot trust people about data gathering üò§ Even when we have talked and confirmed the structure before, they still made crazy changes. 
- For example, even though we all agreed to have at least the time/date column, a lot of group doesn't have it. They also don't record enough 225 cars.
- Moreover, the way we format time and date are all different, thus it has to be managed independently
