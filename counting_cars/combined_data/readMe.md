# Counting Cars Combined üöó

## Minh Nguyen ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Introduction
This project is the next step of the Counting Cars project, which took all of my DATA-332 classmates' data, wrangled, cleaned and ingested them into my previous shiny app. This project focuses on data wrangling and data cleaning, following the tidy data guideline.

## Data Dictionary üìñ
Our dataset includes the following columns:

- **date**: recorded date
- **time**: recorded time
- **initial_speed**: first observed car speed
- **slow_down**: whether the car slow down after seeing the sign or not
- **body_type**: car style
- **vehicle_style**: Car style


## Data Summary
- The lowest speed recorded is 10 miles/h
- The highest speed recorded is 44 miles/h
- The average speed recorded is 29.24 miles/h

## Key Findings

### Time Analysis

- The chart shows Afternon is the most frequently observed time with more than 600 cars, followed by Morning and Evening.
- This either suggests that students are mostly free in the afternoon to observe car, or that afternoon has more cars on the road.
- Either way, this is just a brief conclusion, with further study including larger random sample needed.



### Vehicle Style Analysis
![Net Sentiment](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/DATA-332/blob/main/counting_cars/combined_data/graphs/body_type.png)
- The chart shows that SUVs are the most common vehicle type with nearly 400 cars, followed by sedans (300) and pickup trucks/trucks (120).
- Other styles like hatchbacks, bugs, and coupes the least.
- This suggests SUVs and sedans make up the majority of vehicles observed in the area.



### Speed Analysis

- We decided to make a stacked bar chart and group the mph by every 5 miles for the x value and get the count of cars for the y value
- Therefore, we can get a range of what mph range is most likely to slow down.
- The speed range that slowed down the most was 26-30 mph.
- It is important to note that the speed limit for that spot was 30 mph.

## Reflection

# What I learned in general
- How to deploy a shiny app and the importance of file organization. I was struggling to deploy the app due to mismatch in my file path :))) It was painful
- Importance of planning ahead. Instead of blindly cleaning each file, I set up a clear data structure before hand following the tidy data guideline. This serves as a guiding map and save so much time!

# What I learned about collecting data
- Cannot trust people about data gathering :))) Even when we have talked and confirmed the structure before, they still made crazy changes.
